       "'✅ Trip Verified |  My flight on on 12 May 2023 got delayed an hour and 25 minutes which resulted in the cancellation of our connection flight on 12 May 2023 as the arrival of the first flight was only 15 before the departure of the second connecting flight. We contacted the BA call center multiple times to make changes to the flight in order to still arrive on the 12th of May to KEF airport through different flights. The team tried to find a solution but none made sense, not even on the next day the 13th of May 2023. We have made full booking of accommodation, car rental, activities etc for the vacation in Iceland. The cancellation of of these booking is not refundable. The call center suggested that we cancel the flight for a full refund, then claim compensation for the delay and difference in airfare cost and other non refundable bookings due to the delay and cancellation of our flight. British Airways responded to the claim after a month with no compensation at all, even though we paid additional $600 on new bookings and additional charges. The refund of the cancelled flight took more than a month with multiple calla to follow up almost every week. I was promised to get refund on the first call but later I found out it was not processed properly. Every-time I call the agent ask questions about why flight was canceled etc which is annoying when my understanding everything was under process for payment. After multiple calls I was refunded partially and not the full amount which is even bizarre from a company of this level. I had to make more calls to get the remaining balance refunded. The whole experience was terrible.'"

Short-ish walk to the gate good welcome on board and drinks served quickly. Couldn't fault any aspect of the experience and we took off and landed on time and managed a good five hours sleep out of the ten hours duration. Love the Arrivals Lounge at LHR.

Service after take off was very quick and professional the food was very good and not hurried giving us 3.5 hours to sleep. The seats were very comfortable and the extra space was appreciated. My only complaint is my TV monitor was faulty and had a black line down the screen. It was not an issue as I was planning to sleep rather than watch a movie. The cabin was quieter than economy as it was at the front of the plane and I had a good 3 hours sleep. The Flight attendants were offering drinks throughout the flight which was good. The breakfast was a croissant in a box which I found a bit of a disappointment. Overall I would fly BA Premium Economy again.'"
